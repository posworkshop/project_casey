* Stamina

  In souls, stamina is used for both offensive and defensive. 

  It's resource management.

  If I were to just have attack cooldown tied to animation frames, I need to somehow make that a resource management system.

  Dark Souls:

  Attack attack attack, out of stamina, can't roll, can't block, got hit

  Attack attack, some stamina, can roll or block

  Translate:

  Attack attack attack, out of something, can't roll, can't block, got hit
